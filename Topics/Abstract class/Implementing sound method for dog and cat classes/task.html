<h2>Implementing sound method for dog and cat classes</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<div class="alert alert-warning">Hey there! This problem might be a bit unpredictable, but give it a go and let us know how you do!</div>Consider a zoo management system where you are tasked to create an abstract class 'Animal' with a method 'sound()' that will return the sound made by that specific animal. You should define two subclasses: 'Dog' and 'Cat' that implement this method. The sound of a 'Dog' should be 'Bark!' and for 'Cat' it should be 'Meow!'. You get the name of the animal as an input string ('Dog' or 'Cat'). Write a program that creates an instance of the appropriate class based on the input and returns the sound made by the animal.<br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Dog<br></code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Bark!<br></code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 5 seconds</font><br><br>
